# RootChordGen
A [protoplug](https://www.osar.fr/protoplug/) script that detects the chord, even if it's an inversion, and adds the root note of the chord.

# Parameters
- N of Chord notes - The number of notes in the chord.
- Base note start - The first base note. Base notes should be between this note and one octave above it.
